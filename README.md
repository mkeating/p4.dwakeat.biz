Final project for CSCI E-15

HumbleTales, a collaborative storytelling app


This app allows 4 people to write a short story together. The first user starts the story, and enters the email of the person to whom they want to pass the story on to. The app will send an email to that person with a notification that someone wants to write with them (if they are already a member) or, if they aren't a member, the email will include a referral link for them to sign up and then be assigned to the story. Each users home page displays either the story to which they are assigned or the form to start a new story. 

There is also a library which displays all finished stories and the ability to view stories by each writer. 

Javascript controls limiting each story part to 200 words. 

There is currently no way for a user to "refuse" a story, so only send to willing parties or the story will be stuck in limbo forever.
